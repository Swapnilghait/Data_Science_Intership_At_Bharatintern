**Data_Science_Intership_At_Bharatintern**

**Welcome to my internship showcase as part of the Bharat Intern Internship September 2023 with Bharat Intern.**

**In this repository, I present my significant tasks I accomplished during my internship:**

**Task 1: SMS_EMAIL CLASSIFIER :**

**Develop a text classification model to
classify SMS as either spam or non-spam
using data science techniques in Python.**

:: Developed a robust SMS Spam Classification model using Python and advanced data science techniques. The model accurately distinguishes between spam and non-spam SMS messages, enhancing communication security and user experience. Leveraged machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and feature engineering for effective text classification.

Tools: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

Achievements:

Achieved impressive accuracy in classifying spam and non-spam messages.
Enhanced skills in data preprocessing, machine learning, and model evaluation
